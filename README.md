# Weathervane Api

A RESTful API generated by [generator-rest](https://github.com/diegohaz/generator-rest).


## Overview

This API is designed to interface with OpenWeatherMap to provide weather data to a front-end client.

Currently, the app only provides a single `/forecast` endpoint. In the future, it may be expanded to provide more in-depth queries, as well as provide features like:

- User auth + session management DB
- Saving favorite cities to pre-populate a weather dashboard when your user logs in
- More detailed forecasts, beyond the current 5-day overview the API provides
